<center> <h1> &#9658; 5 Examples of Artificial Intelligence</h1></center>
<p> The following example of artificial intelligence are leading the market – companies adopting AI in the years ahead will likely look to the examples below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Siri And Alexa</li>
  <li>Amazon And Online Commerce</li>
  <li>Pandora</li>
  <li>Cogito</li>
  <li>Online Banking</li>

</ul>  
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:160%;">1- Siri And Alexa</p>
<p>The challenge with voice-activated assistants – which play an ever growing role in business – is that they need to actually understand human speech. Even harder: they need to actually understand humans.
<p>
That’s where AI comes in. While the system engineers can build these voice assistants, they can’t embed the vast amount of human idiosyncrasy into them at launch. So these systems make heavy use of machine learning to enable them to get better and better at the exceptionally complex task of human-to-machine interface.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:160%;">2- Amazon And Online Commerce</p>
<p>The concept of a system that responds to customer input isn’t by itself an example of artificial intelligence. For example, those ads for shirts that follow you around the Internet after you’ve casually checked out shirts aren’t necessarily an advanced AI application.
But in the case of Amazon’s recommendation system, it’s a powerhouse of a transactional AI platform. You have likely observed its ability to learn – and keep learning – season after season. In essence, hordes of shoppers are “teaching” the Amazon AI system to better display likely items for sale. 
<p>On a related note, this kind of cutting edge AI system needs a vast computing platform to process all that data. You don’t power a system like that with a small server farm. Clearly, Amazon Web Services has at its disposal a world-leading computing platform.<p>

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:160%;">3- Pandora</p>
<p>For those who say that AI will replace humans, Pandora’s AI system is an example of a system working with the humans. To start, Pandora employs musically-astute humans to analyze and categorize a song. Pandora looks at some 450 attributes of a song, from vocal style to rhythmic feel.
<p>
As the AI algorithm works, it incorporates countless recommendations from users, based on a body of user response to its song library. The AI system can then group and present songs in batches that make sense to masses of users – users who grew up with that style, in many cases.
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:160%;">4- Cogito</p>
<p> It is certainly one of the most active areas of artificial intelligence: using AI to enhance the emotional connection with customers in sales and customer service calls. Specifically, using AI to make an interaction more empathetic than humans alone would make it. To be sure, that’s a final frontier of AI usage.
<p>
Cogito (Latin for “I think”) uses a key truth of human interaction: it’s not just the words that deploy meaning, it’s the way those words are spoken, the mood, tempo, the feel of them.
<p style="color:Tomato;font-size:130%;">What’s next? Software falling on love with you?</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;font-size:160%;">5- Online Banking</p>
<p>Your bank makes you a convenient offer: scan your check and deposit it with your mobile device. No need to visit the actual branch office. The problem: doing so requires a machine to read human hand writing, which is a messy and confusing endeavor – even for humans.
<p>
Among other vendors, Mitek Systems specializes in software-based identity verification. It’s AI technology uses computer vision and machine learning to make mobile-to-bank transactions safe (or at least safer).
<p>
Mitek, for instance, employs a vision algorithm to classify countless ID formats in banking transactions. Core to this is Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software that scans documents and converts that data into a editable format. The OCR software can be adjusted with AI to accurately extract personal signifiers.<p>
